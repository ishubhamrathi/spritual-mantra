                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Choose a quiet spot that is free of distractions.</i> Turn off your phone, television, and other distractions. If you choose to play quiet music, select something calm and repetitive.</li>
                        <li><i>Set a time limit.</i> If you are just getting started, you might want to stick to shorter sessions of about 5 to 10 minutes in length.</li>
                        <li><i>Pay attention to your body and get comfortable.</i> You can sit cross-legged on the floor or in a chair as long as you feel that you can sit comfortably for several minutes at a time.</li>
                        <li><i>Focus on your breathing.</i> Try taking deep breaths that expand your belly and then slowly exhale. Pay attention to how each breath feels.</li>
                        <li><i>Notice your thoughts.</i> The purpose of meditation is not to clear your mindâ€”your mind is inevitably going to wander. Instead, focus on gently bringing your attention back to your breath whenever you notice your thoughts drifting. Don't judge your thoughts or try to analyze them; simply direct your mind back to your deep breathing.</li>
